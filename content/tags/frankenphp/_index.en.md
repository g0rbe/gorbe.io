FrankenPHP is a modern application server for PHP built on top of the Caddy web server. 
FrankenPHP gives superpowers to your PHP apps thanks to its stunning features: Early Hints, worker mode, real-time capabilities, automatic HTTPS, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 support.
FrankenPHP works with any PHP app and makes your Laravel and Symfony projects faster than ever thanks to their official integrations with the worker mode.
FrankenPHP can also be used as a standalone Go library to embed PHP in any app using net/http.
