## Signals

- signals are used to notify processes about events in Inter Process Communication
- signal is an asynchronous event:
    - not expected
    - expected, but the time is not know
- signals are sent from the kernel or from a user process via system call with `kill`
- user can send signal to his own processes 
- root can send signal to any process
- signals can be handled differently by the programmer or resbond acording to the system defaults
- two signal always use the system default: **SIGKILL** and **SIGSTOP**
- signal has a type and the type is indicate the meaning of the signal
- signals handle:
    - exceptions detected by the hardware 
    - exceptions generated by the environment
- when signal sent from the kernel: the meaning attached to the signal
- The **full list** if signals is [here][1]
- **SIGTERM**: kills the process gracefully
- **SIGKILL**: kills the process immediately 
- **SIGRTMIN**:
    - no predefined purpose
    - can be stacked, handled in *FIFO*
