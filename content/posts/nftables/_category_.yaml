  description: >
    nftables is the modern Linux kernel packet classification framework.
    New code should use it instead of the legacy {ip,ip6,arp,eb}_tables (xtables) infrastructure.
    For existing codebases that have not yet converted, the legacy xtables infrastructure is still maintained as of 2021.
    Automated tools assist the xtables to nftables conversion process.
