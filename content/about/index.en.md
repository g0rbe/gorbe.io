I have been dealing with cyber security and IT systems operation for more than 5 years, of which I have provided system administrator services to businesses in and around Gy≈ër for the last three years.
My area of expertise is the operation and protection of Linux-based servers.

My clients describe me as a helpful, problem-oriented person.
I quickly find common ground with everyone, thanks to which I work quickly and efficiently in a team.
I pay special attention to development. I help make a decision with suggestions and testable demos.
In addition to the infrastructure, I also keep my knowledge up-to-date so that I can provide the best technology solutions, as I know that innovative ideas have outstanding added value.

My goal is to build and operate a safe, stable and cost-effective infrastructure that can serve hundreds of thousands of customers with 99.9% availability.
I constantly monitor the existing systems so that I can react immediately to errors that occur.
In addition to security, I pay particular attention to avoiding data loss and to user-friendly design so that the work goes smoothly.

I have helped many of my partners to modernize and further develop their businesses.
I have successfully completed every project, be it a custom-made website or a fully automated infrastructure supported by artificial intelligence.
